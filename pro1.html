  <h3> ABOUT</h3>
  </center>
  <fieldset>
  <P>
    In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. 
    In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants
    that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height.
    A tree is a tall plant that can live for a very long time. It has a single stem or trunk and branches that support leaves. Beneath the ground, a tree has a root system that acts as an anchor and stores the water and nutrients the plant needs to grow.

      <li>Trees are the main source of Oxygen.</li>
      <li>An average tree produces enough oxygen to fulfil the oxygen need of four people.</li>
      <li>Trees help in absorbing dust and other pollutants from the air, thus cleaning it.</li>
      <li>The land under the tree absorbs more rainwater and helps prevent floods.</li>
      <li>Trees also absorb a considerable amount of sound and help reducing noise pollution.</li>

  <h3><center>EFFECTS</center></h3>
  <br>
  <fieldset>
  <p>
    The loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification, soil erosion, 
    fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a host of problems for Indigenous people.
    In terms of climate change, cutting trees both adds carbon dioxide to the air and removes the ability to 
    absorb existing carbon dioxide.Deforestation, which is the loss of wild forest habitats due to human activity, has grown into a global problem as demand for wood climbs. Shrinking forests can cause wide-reaching problems, including soil erosion, 
    water cycle disruption, greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity losses.
